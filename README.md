# espresso
script for sl piped to lolcat

To make an alias run the install.sh then you should source your shell and you can use espresso

Note: I made this to have fun none of the codes are mine except .sh files you can check the original creators of [lolcat](https://github.com/jaseg/lolcat) and [sl](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl).
